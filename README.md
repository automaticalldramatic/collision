## What

Given these 3 images:

Car: ![Car](http://i47.tinypic.com/2wh0dqo.png)
Wall: ![Wall](http://i48.tinypic.com/20qe0k6.png)
Bang: ![Bang](http://i50.tinypic.com/20tromb.png)

Create a layout which displays a car moving towards the wall, when the car hits the wall, the car and wall disappear and the bang image grows in size and fills up the screen. You will have 3 buttons that control the layout, a "start," "stop," and "rewind". Clicking on rewind, after pausing, reverses the flow.

## Use 

jQuery, HTML, CSS
